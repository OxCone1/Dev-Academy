# Helsinki City Bike App

üö≤ Welcome to the Helsinki City Bike App! üåá

This is the pre-assignment for Solita Dev Academy Finland 2023. The app displays data from journeys made with city bikes in the Helsinki Capital area. You can explore the journeys, stations, and various statistics related to the bike usage.

# Frontend

## 1. Map (Stations) ([Leaflet library](https://leafletjs.com/))

- The map displays the locations of the stations in the Helsinki Capital area. The stations are marked with a bike parking icon(Pic.1). When you click on a station, the station's name, address and dynamically fetched statistics for the station are displayed. The statistics include average distance of journeys started from the station, average distance of journeys ended at the station, top 5 stations where started from this station journeys ended, and top 5 stations where ended at this station journeys started(Pic.2).

- On the side of station page there is a list of all the stations with enabled search bar(Pic.3), so you can search for a specific station, enabled pagination and page item limit. Also, when station is clicked in that list, it will located on the map and statistics will be displayed.

### 2. Map (Journeys) ([Leaflet library](https://leafletjs.com/))

- The journeys page displays a list of all the journeys made with city bikes in the Helsinki Capital area. Journeys contain the start and end times, duration, distance, and the stations where the journey started and ended(Pic.1). The list is paginated and the page item limit can be adjusted. The journeys can be sorted by the start and end times of the journey, the duration of the journey, and the distance of the journey in ascending or descending order(Pic.2). 

- When you click on a journey, it is displayed on the map with a line between the start and end stations(Pic.3).

### 3. Adding Journeys/Stations

- This functionality is only available if user is logged in. But because there was no requirement to implement user registration, I have created a default user with username: "admin" and password: "admin". So, you can login with these credentials and add journeys and stations(Pic.1).

- The app allows you to add new journeys and stations to the database. The journeys and stations could be added by clicking on the "Add" button that will call a drop-down menu where you can choose to add a journey or a station(Pic.2). The journeys and stations are added to the database and displayed on the journeys and stations pages respectively.   

- When adding station or journey you will have to fill a form in shown modal(Pic.3). Input information carefully, as let's say, latitude and longitude are really sensitive to input. If you will input wrong latitude and longitude, station will still be added, but it might be located in the middle of nowhere.
